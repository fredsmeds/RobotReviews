according to the info on 1_variables_operators if I define a variable such as

age = 25
age = 30
new_age = 35

and then in na additional cell I call the variable 'age' and run the cell, I should obtain the last variable, and indeed it happens.

However, when I try to use either the print() feat. (i.g. print(new_age)) I will have an error. 

Furthermore, what I am understanding from the lesson is that both features have the same function. 

Anaconda AI assistant states that "there might also be a conflict with a function or method that you are trying to call."

Does this mean that I can't use both functions? Because by the excercise notebook logic, it seems that it is possible
here is a screenshot of my notebook. Thank you so much in advance <3

b. Project/lab you are working on
AI Engeneering, Prework excercises

c. What have you tried already?
I have used the Jupyter integrated AI for information. Says the variable has not been defined but it has in Cell 94

d. Urgency of your request
